Overview

This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. Using machine learning techniques, we train a model to classify Arabic letters from handwritten images, facilitating text recognition and digitization of handwritten Arabic scripts.

Dataset

We utilize the Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset (AHCD) available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of labeled Arabic character images, aiding in supervised learning tasks.
