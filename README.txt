Overview:

This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for recognizing Arabic handwritten characters. Using machine learning techniques, we train a model to classify Arabic letters from handwritten images, digitization of handwritten Arabic scripts.

Dataset:

I used the Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset (AHCD) available on Kaggle. The dataset consists of labeled Arabic character images, it helps with supervised learning tasks.
